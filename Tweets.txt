Hey microscopy twitter: can you help me track down an artifact?

Our @LeicaMicro SP8 with a @PicoQuant lifetime system gives a spike in the lifetime histogram at 20 ns. Anybody know why?

I made a github repo with sample data and code to demonstrate:

The relative magnitude of the signal is smaller when the sample gives more signal.

Anybody else seeing this? Please tag your favorite FLIM experts, especially folks familiar with @picoquant

Here it is again in a dye solution, with a different timebinning.

Usually when I debug, I built the instrument, so I know where all the bodies are buried. I always feel a bit helpless trying to debug a commercial instrument.

This has to be simple, right? What am I missing?
